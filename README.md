# Cplusplus-Targeting-and-Neural-Network
This is an incomplete personal project, containing a basic targeting system, and a feed-forward neural network with backpropagation (the latter was meant to be used to improve the targeting system, hence why files from both projects are mixed together). This version of the targeting system was designed to be used for FRC robotics, designed to filter out a target from an image based on its HSV (hue/saturation/value) levels and estimate the distance and angle (both horizontal and vertical) to it.

Please note that the code is unrefined and may be somewhat difficult to read, since I'm working on this alone and did not intend for anybody else to see it until it's done. Might end up rewriting the neural network part of the project, at some point.
